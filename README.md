# Car predictor

This is my first ever machine learning application, which I've used to put the knowledge I've gained so far to the test. I've used the decision tree algorithm.

Car.csv includes data on:
1. User age
2. If the user drives their car more than 5 kilometres.
3. The user's preferred car type.

This dataset is fictional, and has been created by modifying the dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steventaylor11/stated-preferences-for-car-choice?resource=download)

The output provides predictions on what type of car the user would like, given the parameters.
